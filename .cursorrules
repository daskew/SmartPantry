You are an expert full-stack developer. We are building "PantryPulse," a family inventory app.
STYLING: Use Tailwind CSS. Keep the vibe clean, modern, and mobile-first.
TECH STACK: Next.js, Lucide Icons, Framer Motion for animations.
CORE LOGIC: 
1. Ingredients have: Name, Quantity, Expiration Date, Category, Location.
2. The "Natural Language" input should take a string like "Added 3 cartons of milk expiring next Friday" and parse it into structured data.
3. Support a "Family View" where recipes can be shared.
